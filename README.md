5. Add the following details:
   - **Repository:** `https://github.com/Ediminator/hacs-homematicip-hcu/`
   - **Category:** `Integration`
6. Click **ADD**
7. Close the custom repositories window
8. Search for **"Homematic IP Local (HCU)"** in HACS
9. Click **DOWNLOAD** and confirm
10. **Restart Home Assistant** when prompted

---

### Step 2: Enable the HCU Local API

Before adding the integration, you must enable the local API on your HCU.

1. Open your HCU's web interface (HCUweb) in a browser:
   - Try `https://hcu1-XXXX.local` (replace `XXXX` with the last 4 digits of your HCU's SGTIN)
   - Or use your HCU's IP address: `https://YOUR_HCU_IP`
   - **Note:** You may see a security warning about the certificate - this is normal, click "Advanced" and proceed

2. Log in to your HCU

3. Navigate to **Developer Mode** in the menu

4. Toggle the switch to **activate Developer Mode**

5. Toggle the switch to **Expose the Connect API WebSocket**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Sometimes the toggle is already activated even on first setup. Please **deactivate and activate the toggle** to ensure it's properly enabled.

6. Leave this page open - you'll need it in the next step!

---

### Step 3: Add the Integration in Home Assistant

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Devices & Services**

2. Click the **+ ADD INTEGRATION** button (bottom right)

3. Search for `Homematic IP Local (HCU)` and select it

4. **First Dialog - Connection Details:**
   - Enter your **HCU's IP address** (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
   - Leave the ports at their default values unless you changed them:
     - Authentication Port: `6969`
     - WebSocket Port: `9001`
   - Click **SUBMIT**

5. **Second Dialog - Authorization:**
   - Switch back to your HCU's web interface (from Step 2)

   - A temporary key will appear (valid for a few minutes)
   - **Copy the entire key** and paste it into Home Assistant
   - Click **SUBMIT**

6. The integration will now connect and discover all your devices! This may take a few moments.

7. You should see a success message and your devices will start appearing in Home Assistant

---

### Step 4: Configure Door Lock PIN (Optional)

If you have a Homematic IP door lock (e.g., HmIP-DLD), you need to provide its PIN for the integration to control it.

> üí° **Why?** The HCU requires a PIN for all lock operations for security reasons.

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Devices & Services**
2. Find the **Homematic IP Local (HCU)** card
3. Click **CONFIGURE**
4. Enter your door lock's **Authorization PIN**

3. Click **CONFIGURE**

### Available Options:

- **Comfort Temperature:** Default temperature (in ¬∞C) used when switching from OFF to HEAT mode
- **Third-Party Device Filters:** Show/hide devices from manufacturers other than eQ-3

---

## üîò Working with Buttons & Remote Controls

**‚≠ê This is the most common question, so read this section carefully!**

### Understanding Button Devices

Stateless button devices (wall switches, remote controls, etc.) work differently from regular switches in Home Assistant:

**‚ùå You will NOT see:**
- Button entities in your entity list
- Buttons in the device card
- Toggle switches for each button

**‚úÖ You WILL get:**
- Events fired on the Home Assistant event bus
- Full control via automations
- Support for multi-button scenarios

**Why?** Stateless buttons don't maintain an on/off state - they only send momentary press signals. Home Assistant's standard approach for these devices is to use events, which provides much more flexibility for automations.

---

### Supported Button Devices

This integration supports button events for:

**Wall Switches:**
- HmIP-WGS (Wall-mounted Glass Switch) ‚≠ê **Fixed in v1.8.1**
- HmIP-WRC2 (2-button Wall Remote)
- HmIP-WRC6 (6-button Wall Remote) ‚≠ê **Fixed in v1.8.1**
- HmIP-WRCC2 (Wall Remote with Display)
- HmIP-BRC2 (2-button Remote Control)
- And more...

**Remote Controls:**
- HmIP-KRC4 (4-button Key Ring Remote)
- HmIP-RC8 (8-button Remote)
- HmIP-KRCK (Key Ring Remote with Display)
- And more...

**Contact Interfaces (when configured as buttons):**
- HmIP-FCI1 (Flush-mount Contact Interface 1)
- HmIP-FCI6 (Flush-mount Contact Interface 6)
- HmIP-SCI (Shutter Contact Interface)

---

### Step-by-Step: Testing Your Buttons

Before creating automations, verify your buttons are working:

#### 1. Open the Events Monitor

1. Go to **Developer Tools** ‚Üí **Events** (in the sidebar)
2. In the "Listen to events" section, type: `hcu_integration_event`
3. Click **START LISTENING**

#### 2. Press Your Buttons

- Press any button on your Homematic IP device
- You should immediately see an event appear in the event monitor

#### 3. Understand the Event Data

When a button is pressed, you'll see something like this:

```yaml
event_type: hcu_integration_event
data:
  device_id: "3014F711A00048240995D6BC"
  channel: "4"
  type: "press"
origin: LOCAL
time_fired: 2025-10-26T10:30:45.123456+00:00
```

**What each field means:**
- `device_id`: The unique ID of your button device (SGTIN)
- `channel`: Which button was pressed (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- `type`: Always "press" for button events

#### 4. Note Down Your Device ID and Channels

**Important:** You'll need these values for your automations!

- Write down your `device_id`
- Note which `channel` corresponds to each physical button

**üí° Tip:** You can find your device_id more easily in the diagnostics file - see the [Diagnostics section](#-diagnostics--troubleshooting) below.

---

### Creating Button Automations

Now that you've confirmed your buttons work, let's create automations!

#### Method 1: Visual Editor (Recommended for Beginners)

**Example: Turn on a light when button 1 is pressed**

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Automations & Scenes**
2. Click **+ CREATE AUTOMATION** ‚Üí **Create new automation**
3. **Add Trigger:**
   - Click **ADD TRIGGER**
   - Select **Event**
   - Event type: `hcu_integration_event`
4. **Add Condition:**
   - Click **ADD CONDITION**
   - Select **Template**
   - Template:
     ```jinja
     {{ trigger.event.data.device_id == '3014F711A00048240995D6BC' and trigger.event.data.channel == '1' }}
     ```
   - Replace the device_id and channel with your values!
5. **Add Action:**
   - Click **ADD ACTION**
   - Select **Call service**
   - Service: `light.turn_on`
   - Target: Choose your light
6. **Save** your automation with a descriptive name

---

#### Method 2: YAML (For Advanced Users)

**Example 1: Simple Toggle**

```yaml
alias: "Living Room - Button 1 Toggle Light"
description: "Toggle living room light with wall switch button 1"
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: hcu_integration_event
    event_data:
      device_id: "3014F711A00048240995D6BC"
      channel: "1"
action:
  - service: light.toggle
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
mode: single
```

**Example 2: Multi-Button Control (Choose Action by Button)**

```yaml
alias: "Kitchen Remote - 4 Buttons"
description: "Control multiple lights with a 4-button remote"
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: hcu_integration_event
    event_data:
      device_id: "3014F711A00048240995D6BC"
action:
  - choose:
      - conditions:
          - condition: template
            value_template: "{{ trigger.event.data.channel == '1' }}"
        sequence:
          - service: light.turn_on
            target:
              entity_id: light.kitchen_main
      
      - conditions:
          - condition: template
            value_template: "{{ trigger.event.data.channel == '2' }}"
        sequence:
          - service: light.turn_off
            target:
              entity_id: light.kitchen_main
      
      - conditions:
          - condition: template
            value_template: "{{ trigger.event.data.channel == '3' }}"
        sequence:
          - service: light.turn_on
            target:
              entity_id: light.kitchen_cabinet
      
      - conditions:
          - condition: template
            value_template: "{{ trigger.event.data.channel == '4' }}"
        sequence:

            target:
              entity_id: light.kitchen_cabinet
mode: single
```

**Example 3: Same Button for On/Off (Double Press Detection)**

```yaml
alias: "Bedroom - Button 1 with Double Press"
description: "Single press = dim light, double press = full brightness"
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: hcu_integration_event
    event_data:
      device_id: "3014F711A00048240995D6BC"
      channel: "1"
action:
  - if:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: timer.button_press_timer
        state: active
    then:
      # Second press detected within 1 second
      - service: light.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: light.bedroom
        data:
          brightness: 255
      - service: timer.cancel
        target:
          entity_id: timer.button_press_timer
    else:
      # First press - start timer
      - service: timer.start
        target:
          entity_id: timer.button_press_timer
        data:
          duration: "00:00:01"
      - wait_for_trigger:
          - platform: state
            entity_id: timer.button_press_timer
            to: idle
        timeout: "00:00:01"
      # Timer expired - this was a single press
      - if:
          - condition: state
            entity_id: timer.button_press_timer
            state: idle
        then:
          - service: light.turn_on
            target:
              entity_id: light.bedroom
            data:
              brightness: 128
mode: restart
```

*Note: For double-press detection, create a timer helper first:*
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Devices & Services** ‚Üí **Helpers**
2. Click **+ CREATE HELPER** ‚Üí **Timer**
3. Name: "Button Press Timer"
4. Duration: "00:00:01"

### Finding Your Device ID and Channels

**Easiest Method: Use Diagnostics**

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Devices & Services**
2. Find the **Homematic IP Local (HCU)** card and click it
3. Find your button device in the list and click it
4. Click the **three dots** (‚ãÆ) in the top right
5. Select **Download diagnostics** (or just look at the device info on the page)
6. The device ID (SGTIN) is shown clearly

**Manual Method: Diagnostics File**

1. Download the full integration diagnostics:
   - Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services
   - Click on the Homematic IP Local (HCU) card
   - Three dots (‚ãÆ) ‚Üí Download diagnostics

2. Open the JSON file and search for your device name

3. Look for the structure:
   ```json
   "3014F711A00048240995D6BC": {
     "label": "Living Room Wall Switch",
     "functionalChannels": {
       "0": { "functionalChannelType": "DEVICE_BASE" },
       "1": { "functionalChannelType": "SINGLE_KEY_CHANNEL" },
       "2": { "functionalChannelType": "SINGLE_KEY_CHANNEL" },
       "3": { "functionalChannelType": "SINGLE_KEY_CHANNEL" },
       "4": { "functionalChannelType": "SINGLE_KEY_CHANNEL" }
     }
   }
   ```

4. Note:
   - The long string is your `device_id`
   - Channels 1, 2, 3, 4 are your buttons (ignore channel 0 - it's always the maintenance channel)

---

### Troubleshooting Button Events

**Problem: No events appear when I press buttons**

‚úÖ **Solutions:**
1. **Update to v1.8.1 or later** - Critical bug fixes for HmIP-WGS and HmIP-WRC6
2. **Verify the device is connected:**
   - Check Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Your device
   - Make sure it's not showing as "unavailable"
3. **Check you're listening to the right event:**
   - Event type must be exactly: `hcu_integration_event` (no spaces, underscores)
4. **Enable debug logging:**
   - See [Debug Logging section](#debug-logging) below
   - Look for lines like "Button press detected via..." in the logs
5. **Verify your button device is actually a button:**
   - Not all channels are buttons
   - Check diagnostics to see the channel type

**Problem: I see button entities in my old version**

This is expected if you're upgrading from a very old version (pre-1.5.0). The old button entities were removed because:
- They didn't reflect the actual button press (always showed "unknown")
- Event-based triggers are more flexible and reliable
- This matches Home Assistant's standard approach

Simply delete the old button entities and use event-based automations instead.

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Can I use both the cloud integration and this local integration?

Not recommended. Running both simultaneously may cause conflicts. Choose one approach.

### My button device isn't working (HmIP-WGS, HmIP-WRC6, etc.)

Make sure you're on **v1.8.1 or later**. This version includes critical fixes for button event detection. See the [Button Troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting-button-events) above.

### Why don't I see button entities anymore?

As of v1.5.0, button devices use **event-based triggers** instead of entities. This is the Home Assistant standard for stateless buttons and provides more flexibility. See the [Button section](#-working-with-buttons--remote-controls) for how to use them.

### My device isn't appearing in Home Assistant

1. Verify the device appears in the HCU web interface
2. Check if it's a third-party device (may be filtered)
3. Download diagnostics and check if the device is listed
4. Create an issue on GitHub with your diagnostics file

### The integration says "Failed to connect"

- Verify the HCU's IP address is correct
- Ensure Developer Mode is enabled on the HCU
- Check "Expose the Connect API WebSocket" is enabled
- Verify ports 6969 and 9001 are accessible
- Try accessing the HCU web interface from the same machine running Home Assistant

### My door lock shows as "Unavailable"

Configure the door lock PIN in the integration options (Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí HCU ‚Üí Configure).

### Can I control the HCU itself (reboot, updates, etc.)?

No, this integration only controls devices connected to the HCU. HCU management must be done through the HCU web interface.
